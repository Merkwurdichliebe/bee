# bee
First steps in Rust with a simple Spelling Bee solver.

Enter a 7-letter sequence to display all possible words and pangrams.

Enter 'maximum' to recursively find (rather slowly) the largest values for words and pangrams.

The executable expects to find `wordlist.txt` in the working directory, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/wordnik/wordlist.
